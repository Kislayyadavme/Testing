User Flow Guide
 * User sends /start.
 * Bot prompts the user to join all listed channels.
 * User clicks "‚úÖ I Have Joined (Verify Now)".
 * If verified, the user receives their first 10 pieces of content.
 * The bot then provides their unique referral link and the next tier goal (e.g., "Need 5 more referrals").
 * The user shares the link. When a new user joins via that link, the original user's referral count increases, and they are notified.
 * Once a tier goal is met, clicking the referral button delivers the corresponding reward content.
